# Your Design-Pattern Roadmap 🚀

Welcome to **Your Design-Pattern Roadmap** — a playful, hands-on project born from a fun and educational 8-part article series where we dive deep into classic design patterns with a twist of humor and practical flair.

---

## What Is This Repo About?

This project is my playground for experimenting with design patterns — inspired by the articles I wrote to demystify and make design patterns approachable and memorable.
The goal? To create code examples and a small network library that apply these patterns, helping anyone curious about design patterns see how they work in a real-ish project.

**Spoiler:** There are already plenty of network libraries out there. This one isn’t trying to replace them — it’s here to be a learning companion and a proof of concept wrapped in a fun package.

---

## Why This Project?

* **Educational** — To make design patterns less scary and more fun.
* **Practical** — To show how patterns like Visitor, Observer, Command, Factory, Builder, Interceptor, Singleton, Facade, Prototype, and Dependency Injection can be applied.
* **Humorous** — Because learning should make you smile.

## Read the Articles!

This repo is the companion to a series of articles that break down design patterns in a lighthearted way. Each article focuses on one or two patterns, explaining their purpose and usage through jokes, metaphors, and real code.

Here’s the full roadmap:

| Part | Title & Description                                                                                                                      | Link                |
