# Your Design-Pattern Roadmap 🚀

Welcome to **Your Design-Pattern Roadmap** — a playful, hands-on project born from a fun and educational 8-part article series where we dive deep into classic design patterns with a twist of humor and practical flair.

---

## What Is This Repo About?

This project is my playground for experimenting with design patterns — inspired by the articles I wrote to demystify and make design patterns approachable and memorable.
The goal? To create code examples and a small network library that apply these patterns, helping anyone curious about design patterns see how they work in a real-ish project.

**Spoiler:** There are already plenty of network libraries out there. This one isn’t trying to replace them — it’s here to be a learning companion and a proof of concept wrapped in a fun package.

---

## Why This Project?

* **Educational** — To make design patterns less scary and more fun.
* **Practical** — To show how patterns like Visitor, Observer, Command, Factory, Builder, Interceptor, Singleton, Facade, Prototype, and Dependency Injection can be applied.
* **Humorous** — Because learning should make you smile.

## Read the Articles!

This repo is the companion to a series of articles that break down design patterns in a lighthearted way. Each article focuses on one or two patterns, explaining their purpose and usage through jokes, metaphors, and real code.

Here’s the full roadmap:

## 🚀 How to Use This Code: Dependency Injection Example

This project shows a fun, practical way to implement **Dependency Injection** in Swift, focusing on clean architecture and testability.

Here’s a quick guide to get started with the example:

---

### 1. Create your **AppDependencies** container

This struct holds all your configuration classes that register dependencies for your app.

```swift
import Foundation
import Core

struct AppDependencies {
    static let configs: [Config] = [
        SearchRepositoryConfig(),  // Add all your dependency configs here
    ]
}
```

---

### 2. Configure dependencies in your **AppDelegate**

Inside your app’s `AppDelegate`, call the global injector and pass your configs to register services at launch.

```swift
import Foundation
import SwiftUI
import Core

class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
        GlobalContext.shared.configure(AppDependencies.configs) { }
        return true
    }
}
```

---

### 3. Define each dependency with a Config conforming struct

For example, the Search Repository config maps the protocol to the concrete implementation:

```swift
import Foundation
import Core

struct SearchRepositoryConfig: Config {
    func configure(_ injector: Injectorable) {
        injector.map(SearchRepositorible.self, SearchRepository())
    }
}
```

---

### 4. Implement the actual repository following your domain logic

```swift
import Foundation
import Network

protocol SearchRepositorible {
    func searchPhotos(search: String, page: String?) -> Observer<SearchResponse>
}

final class SearchRepository: SearchRepositorible  {
    func searchPhotos(search: String, page: String?) -> Observer<SearchResponse> {
        let path = "/rest"
        let request = RequestDataBuilder()
            .make(.path(path))
            .make(.method(.get))
            .make(.params(generateParams(search, page)))
        
        return ObserverFactory().executeRequest(request)
    }
}
```

---

### 5. Use injected dependencies in your ViewModel

Inject your dependency with the `@Inject` property wrapper and use it like this:

```swift
final class SearchViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Inject private var repository: SearchRepositorible?

    private func fetchPhotos(_ search: String) {
        repository?.searchPhotos(search: search).complete { [weak self] result in
            if case let Result.success(response) = result {
                self?.photos = response?.photos ?? Photos.Empty
            }
            self?.searching = false
        }
    }
}
```

---

### Summary

* **Configure** your services in `AppDependencies`
* **Register** them in `AppDelegate`
* **Map** interfaces to implementations with Config objects
* **Inject** dependencies into consumers with `@Inject`
* **Use** them freely — decoupled, clean, and testable
